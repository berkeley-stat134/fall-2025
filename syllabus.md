## Overview

Our main text will be Introduction to Probability by Blitzstein and Hwang. We will cover most of this text (details in the schedule). You may also refer to Probability, by Pitman. 

The course is an introduction to the ideas of probability, with no prior knowledge assumed. What is necessary is some degree of mathematical maturity, discussed further in the section on prerequisites. 

The topics we will cover will include the axioms of probability, conditional probabilities, Bayes' rule, discrete and continuous random variables and their distributions, independence of events, and independence of random variables, moments of distributions and moment generating functions, joint, marginal, and conditional distributions, conditional expectations, covariance and correlation, transformations of random variables, limit theorems including the CLT, Law of large numbers, tail probabilities, sampling. Maybe concentration inequalities, ideas of convergence, Markov chains. 

We hope that you will learn how to think about uncertainty and randomness, and develop a strong mathematical foundation as you progress in your study of statistics and data science. Our goal is to equip you with the skills that you need to understand and solve difficult problems in statistical inference, and to appreciate the beautiful ideas in probability theory


(prerequisites)=
## Prerequisites

A year of calculus, so a level of ease with calculus is assumed.

## Logistics and Attendance

### Schedule

The list of topics to be covered and the corresponding chapters to be read will be published here a few weeks at a time, since it can be dynamic. Please do your best to complete the suggested readings before lecture, as it will make your comprehension in lecture much stronger.

### Websites to bookmark:

- The bcourses page: this is the main home of the course, where you will find links to the other sites (ed, gradescope) and where the course materials will be posted. All important announcements will posted here.

- The Ed discussion: please use this to ask all questions that pertain to the course material and do not have personal or private information (you can access the page using the menu on the left). If you have a private question, please post it on Ed as a private post, so only the course staff can see it. If you only wish Prof. S to see it, please go to office hours as that will ensure a more reliable response than email. Remember that Ed is a formal, academic space, not a social forum. We must demonstrate appropriate respect, consideration, and compassion for others. Please be friendly and thoughtful; our community draws from a wide spectrum of valuable experiences. 

- Gradescope: All your assignments will be submitted on gradescope. You should be automatically added via bcourses and should not need a join code.

### Attendance and Lecture Recordings:

Lecture attendance is expected and encouraged, but not mandated or tracked.

Lecture recordings will only be available with requests made ahead of time, or under extenuating circumstances. Though lecture will be recorded using course capture, these recordings will not be released to everyone. Rather, they will be shared with students who have extenuating circumstances and who request it in advance.

For example, if you are not feeling well and cannot make it, this is a legitimate reason, but oversleeping and missing class is not. That said, every student will be entitled to two "free" recordings on request, with no reason needed. After that, you need to provide a better reason than just missing class.

You must make the request within a week of the lecture using the recording request form (link on bcourses). Requests made after a week will not be honored. Lectures missed due to late enrollment will be provided on request, without counting against the two free requests.

Discussion sections: You are expected to attend section, and you must attend the section that you are enrolled in. Attendance is tracked using discussion worksheets that are collected at the end of section. The worksheets are graded for completion and will be returned in the next section meeting. If you attend at least 80% of all the sections, this will contribute extra credit to your grade that will bump your grade to the next bin (for example, from B to B+).  Quizzes will be administered in section, and we do not offer make ups.
