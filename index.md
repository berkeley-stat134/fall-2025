* **Bio**: Hi! I'm Oli, one of the GSIs for this course. I got my undergraduate degree in Applied Mathematics from Berkeley, and I'm currently a student on the Statistics M.A. program. Outside of probability, I love playing Pad√©l (the superior racket sport), eating breakfast and Marin county.

# Schedule

You can have freestyle HTML with colors and styles. <span style="color: blue;">For example, this text is blue.</span>

The table below is rendered by the `schedule` plugin, contributed by [rowanc1](https://github.com/rowanc1). It is declared in `myst.yml` and contained within `schedule.mjs`. It reads in the data in `schedule.yml` and converts it into a table.
